          <h1> Hello there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
          <p> I'm a Technology Risk Advisor working in PwC's London office.
            In short, this means I help companies manage the risks associated with the technology they use or are looking into,
            so that they can maximize the benefits and use technology to their advantage.
          </p>
          <p> I have a passion for technology in my personal life as well, always looking to develop my coding skills
            (like building this website) or reading about how you can solve problems with technology-enabled solutions.
            My main areas of interest are project and product management, but I'm always up for a challenge.
          </p>

            <h3 class="job-title">King's College London</h3>
            <h4 class="jobposition">BSc Business Management, First Class Honours</h4>
            <h4 class="dates">2015 - 2018</h4>
            <p> I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business Management at Kingâ€™s Business School (part of Kingâ€™s College London),
              studying subjects such as Mathematics, Economics or Entrepreneurial Finance.
              My final year dissertation discussed how the institutional context in Romania,
              through secondary and higher education, constrains or enables the way start-ups shape their human capital development strategies.
              The findings showed that the education system in Romania has indeed a large-company bias;
              however, there are many ways in which start-ups overcame this and managed to sustain their growth.
              <p> Whilst studying, I was also an active member and, later on, executive board member of AIESEC City.
                AIESEC is the worldâ€™s largest non-profit youth-run organisation,
                that provides young people with cross-cultural global internships and volunteering experiences. </p>
