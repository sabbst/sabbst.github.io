            <h1> Hello there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
            <p> I'm a Technology Risk Advisor in PwC's London Region Assurance business unit.
              In short, this means I help companies manage the risks associated with their systems, so that they can maximize the benefits and use technology to their advantage.
              This goes all the way from guiding them through complex transformational projects to helping them improve the day-to-day IT operations.</p>
            <p> I was born in Bucharest, Romania and have been living in London for the past 4 years.
              Bit clichÃ©, but I do love traveling and am an avid trip planner.</p>

                <h4 class="dates">2015 - 2018</h4>
                <p> I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business Management at Kingâ€™s Business School (part of Kingâ€™s College London),
                  studying subjects such as Mathematics, Economics or Entrepreneurial Finance.
                  My final year dissertation focused on discussing how the institutional context in Romania,
                  through secondary and higher education, constrains or enables the way start-ups shape their human capital development strategies.
                  The findings showed that the education system in Romania has indeed a large-company bias;
                  however, there are many ways in which start-ups overcame this and managed to sustain their growth.
                  <p> Whilst studying, I was also an active member and, later on, executive board member of AIESEC City.
                    AIESEC is the worldâ€™s largest non-profit youth-run organisation,
                    that provides young people with cross-cultural global internships and volunteering experiences. </p>
